"""JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE422 for the `jplephem` package.

This is the most recent long-period ephemeris published by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, in September 2009.  While requiring 531 MB of
disk space or RAM (roughly half a gigabyte), it achieves quite high
accuracy.

Coordinates and velocities are provided for the major planets, the Sun,
and Earth's Moon for the years -3000 through 3000.  To use this ephemeris
in Python, see the `jplephem <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jplephem>`_
package on the Python Package Index.
