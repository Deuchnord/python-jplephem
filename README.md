Welcome to the repository for the `jplephem` Python library!

The package is a Python implementation of the math that standard JPL
ephemerides use to predict raw (x,y,z) planetary positions.  If you are
simply interested in using it, please head over to its documentation and
download link on the Python Package Index:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jplephem

If you want to install it with `conda`, there is a recipe at:

https://github.com/conda-forge/jplephem-feedstock

This repository is where the development version of `jplephem` is
maintained.  You will find its source code beneath the `jplephem`
directory, alongside its `setup.py` file â€” enjoy!
