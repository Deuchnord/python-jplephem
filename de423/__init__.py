"""JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE423 for the `jplephem` package.

This is the most recent short-period ephemeris published by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, in February 2010.  It requires 36 MB of storage
and achieves especially high accuracy for Mercury and Venus since it was
prepared for the MESSENGER mission, and should be able to predict the
coordinates of those planets within a few milliarcseconds.

Coordinates and velocities are provided for the major planets, the Sun,
and Earth's Moon for the years 1800 through 2200.  To use this ephemeris
in Python, see the `jplephem <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jplephem>`_
package on the Python Package Index.
